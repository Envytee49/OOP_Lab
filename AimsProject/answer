1.- Which classes are aggregates of other classes?
Cart is aggregate of Media. Store is aggregate of Media. CompactDisc is aggregate of Track
2. . If the passing object is not an instance of Media, what happens? 
If the passing object is not an instance of Media, equals() returns false.
3. - What class should implement the Comparable interface?
Class Media implements Comparable interface
4. - In those classes, how should you implement the compareTo()method be to reflect the ordering that we want? 
The compareTo() method needs to return a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer if the current object is less than, equal to, or greater than the specified object, respectively.
5. - Can we have two ordering rules of the item (by title then cost and by cost then title) if we use this Comparable interface approach?
No since Comparable interface is used for internal comparison and can be implemented only once by class Media.
6. - Suppose the DVDs has a different ordering rule from the other media types, that is by title, then decreasing length, then cost. How would you modify your code to allow this? 
I override compareTo() method in DigitalVideoDisc.
