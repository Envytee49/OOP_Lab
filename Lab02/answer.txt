Java does not allow you to create two constructors that have the same number of parameters and the same types of parameters since it will make the program ambiguous. 
However, when we try to run the program, it still works. 
This means that the error we are seeing is most likely a warning generated by our IDE, and not a compilation error. 
In other words, the code is compiled and executed without any issues, but the IDE is highlighting that there is a potential issue with the code.
