- What happens if users choose “Cancel”?
=> The dialog will be no by default
- How to customize the options to users, e.g. only two options: “Yes” and “No”, OR “I do”
and “I don’t”
=> We can do that by adding arguments to the JOptionPane.showOptionDialog ~ showOptionDialog(Component, Object, String, int, int, Icon, Object[], Object) 
To be specific, we will focus on the Object[] argument which is a string array that consists the users' option. In this case is “Yes” and “No”, OR “I do”
and “I don’t”.
Also, we add other arguments.
Example code:
    String[] options = {"I do", "I don't"};
		int option = JOptionPane.showOptionDialog(null, 
				"Do you want to change to the first class ticket?",
          "Title", JOptionPane.YES_NO_OPTION, JOptionPane.QUESTION_MESSAGE, null, options, options[0]);
This will display a dialog box which asks the user if they want to change to the first class ticket, and provides two options to choose from: "I do" and "I don't"
